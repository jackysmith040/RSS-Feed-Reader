# Terminal RSS Feed Reader

This is a simple RSS feed reader that displays feed information in your terminal. It is written in Ruby and uses the Feedjira and HTTParty gems to parse and display RSS feeds.

## Usage

To use the reader, simply run the `rss_feed.rb` file in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter the URL of the RSS feed you want to read. If you press Enter without entering a URL, the reader will use the default URL (<https://techcrunch.com/feed/>).

The reader will then display the title and description of the feed, followed by a list of the entries in the feed. For each entry, the reader will display the published date, title, summary, and URL.

## Installation

To use the reader, you will need to have Ruby installed on your system. You can download Ruby from the official website: <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>

You will also need to install the Feedjira and HTTParty gems. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```Ruby
gem install feedjira
gem install httparty
```

Once you have Ruby and the required gems installed, you can download the `rss_feed.rb` file from this repository and run it in your terminal.

## Example

Here's an example of the reader in action:

```Ruby
$ ruby rss_feed.rb
Enter the URL of the RSS feed you want to read (or press Enter to use the default URL)
